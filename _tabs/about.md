I’m Rohan Pagey. I’m a Senior Security Analyst at HackerOne and a hacker at heart. I’ve been hacking websites (ethically) since I was 18. What started as a curious hobby turned into a full-blown career, and now I spend my days finding vulnerabilities, helping secure systems, reversing malwares, and learning something new every step of the way.

When away from computers, I enjoy cooking authentic Indian food, hiking, and meditating - (sometimes in the same order 😁). I also love taking long walks, especially when they lead to a spectacular sunset. Here's one to brighten your day:
